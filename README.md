#Sanssouci

This is a loose collection of scripts, rulesets and tools I use to make certain tabletop RPGs more worry free. A rough overview of whats in store:

rules/
  rules.org - Alternate ruleset for the most popular tabletop RPG, to be used in conjunction with http://github.com/mjgerdes/fwg.git
  coc.org - Caves of Chaos description file
  encounters.org - Example encounters that were randomly generated by monsters.py

monster/
  monsters.json - Monster database taken from free SRD.
  monsters.py - Script to output org-mode formated file or to generate random encounters.

dungeme/
  dungeme.py - Utility to create and navigate dungeon graphs in a shell. Has mud like controls, very accessible for the visually impaired.
    examples/
	    coc.js - Caves of Chaos example dungeon.
		    station.js SciFi example dungeon
